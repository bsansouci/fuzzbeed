Organized and methodical in their approach, they can generally succeed at any task which they undertake."+

If you have not developed their intuitive side sufficiently, they may become overly obsessed with structure, and insist on doing everything by the book."+

For this reason, you often works long hours, and may be unwittingly taken advantage of."+

However, they will resist putting energy into things which don't make sense to them, or for which they can't see a practical application. They prefer to work alone, but work well in teams when the situation demands it. They like to be accountable for their actions, and enjoy being in positions of authority.
